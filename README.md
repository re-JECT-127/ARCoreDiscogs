# ARCoreDiscogs

ARCoreDiscogs is a Google ARCore based application where we're attempting to combine Googles ARCore image recognition functionality with the Discogs API.

## Installation
Just go ahead and download the zip and import it into Android Studio

You can drop your zip into the AndroidStudioProjects folder to make it a bit easier to find it.

## Usage
To use the app just press the FAB to start scanning a record or the barcode scan button to scan a barcode, the database for now is still extremely limited, as we have not figured out a good way to implement a larger one.
Feel free to add onto it on your own or come up with alternate solutions.

## Contributing
Honestly you can do whatever you want with this code.
